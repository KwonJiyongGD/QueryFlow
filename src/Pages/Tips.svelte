	<h1>PostgreSQL database efficiency</h1>
	<p>Below are some general options mitigate slow performing queries</p>
	<h3>Use Indexes Wisely</h3>
	<p>
		Proper indexing can greatly improve query performance. Identify the columns frequently used in
		WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions and create indexes on those columns. However, be cautious not
		to over-index, as too many indexes can negatively impact write performance. Over time consider
		adjusting or adding indexes based on query patterns and workload changes.
	</p>
	<h3>Optimize Joins</h3>
	<p>
		select appropriate join algorithms (nested loop, hash join, merge join) based on the size of the
		tables, available indexes, and join conditions. Ensure the join columns have proper indexes, and
		consider restructuring the query or breaking it into smaller parts using subqueries or Common
		Table Expressions (CTEs) to optimize performance.
	</p>
	<h3>Avoid Overfetching</h3>
	<p>
		Fetch only the necessary data in your queries. Look for places where queries are fetching
		columns or rows that arenâ€™t required. Using proper filtering and projection to retrieve only the
		relevant data will reduce network traffic and improve query performance.
	</p>
	<h3>Refactor your Query Strings</h3>
	<p>
		Review your queries and consider refactoring them. Look for complex subqueries, unnecessary
		joins or redundant conditions. Additionally, restructuring the query logic can sometimes achieve
		the same result with more efficiency.
	</p>
	<h3>Consider Denormalization</h3>
	<p>
		In certain scenarios, denormalizing your data by duplicating or aggregating information can
		improve query performance. This approach can reduce the need for complex joins or calculations,
		making queries faster. Considering the trade-offs in terms of data consistency, available space
		in the database, and potential update anomalies.
	</p>
	<h1>Secondary Databases</h1>
	<p>
		Caching in a secondary database is an ideal option for fast data retrieval. Especially for
		queries where SQL optimization is not feasible. Caching is configurable for most SQL databases
		but geocaching is another option. See the QueryFlow auto caching engine.
